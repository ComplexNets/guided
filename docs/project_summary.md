### **Purpose**

The project aims to provide a secure, AI-assisted journaling platform where users can record their thoughts and experiences, then receive contextually relevant psychological feedback. By incorporating multiple “personalities” or therapeutic perspectives (e.g., Jungian, CBT, supportive, stern), the platform helps users gain deeper self-awareness and motivation.

### **Intent**

- **Facilitate Personal Growth**: Support users in regular reflection on their emotional well-being and personal experiences.
- **Offer Tailored Insights**: Leverage AI to deliver feedback in various styles or therapeutic modalities.
- **Maintain Data Privacy**: Ensure that all journal entries and user data are stored securely and remain confidential.

### **User Needs**

- **Simple Journaling Flow**: A clean, intuitive interface for creating, editing, and reviewing journal entries.
- **Personalized Feedback**: The ability to choose a “feedback style” (e.g., Jungian, CBT) or rely on the AI to offer a consistent viewpoint.
- **Secure & Private Data**: Clear assurances on how sensitive information is handled, using secure authentication and encrypted data storage.

### **Tech Stack**

- **Back End**:
    - **Python (3.9+)**
    - **Django** (for quick development, built-in auth, and templating)
- **Database**:
    - **PostgreSQL** (reliable relational storage, easily hosted on Railway)
- **AI Integration**:
    - **OpenAI API** (for generating text-based feedback from user entries)
- **Front End**:
    - **Django Templates** + **Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS** for a clean, mobile-responsive UI without needing a separate SPA framework
- **Deployment**:
    - **Railway** (hosting both the Django application and PostgreSQL database)
    - **Gunicorn** (production server)

### **AI Approach: Good Prompting**

Instead of implementing a more complex, agent-based orchestration framework, this project will rely on **well-crafted prompts** to generate relevant, psychologically oriented feedback. By preparing distinct system prompts for each “feedback personality” (e.g., Jungian vs. CBT) and guiding the model’s responses, the app can provide nuanced insights without the overhead of managing multi-step reasoning or external tool usage. Should future needs evolve—such as deeper session-based analysis or specialized retrieval of past entries—there is room to introduce an agent approach at a later stage.
